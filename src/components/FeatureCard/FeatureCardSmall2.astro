/**
 * * These are small cards with icons, titles, and text
 * This looks best with an even number of cards. They are smaller to
 * use with more cards in the same section. 6 cards is probably ideal
 *
 * ! I copy all icons into the src/icons folder and recommend you do the same
 * ! If the icon is at src/icons/tabler/paint.svg then you put in "tabler/paint"
